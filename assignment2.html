    <h2>Assignment 2</h2>
    
    <h3>Section 1.1 - What's Going Into my Webpage</h3>
    <p>Each of my webpages will have a solid background and white text in the Gill Sans font. The main page will have an ‘about me’ section, 
        in addition to links leading to pages detailing the assignments. These sub-pages will have a top bar containing buttons, one for 
        returning to the home page, and others for quickly navigating between different sections of the assignment. The sections will be 
        organised in sequential order, and every few sections there will be a link that can be clicked to return to the top of the page.
        </p>
    
    <h3>Section 1.5 - Copyright and Fair Use</h3>
    <p>When collecting research and images for a site, one is almost guaranteed to run into copyrighted content. Put simply, this is content 
        that is legally owned by an individual or company (the copyright holder) and to use it requires permission, either by a spoken agreement 
        or exchange of royalties. If an individual fails to comply with this, they risk being liable to legal action by the copyright holder.
        </p>
    <p>There are some exceptions, however, to this law. One such exception is Fair Use - if copyrighted content is used in a transformative and 
        limited enough way, or is not used for monetary gain, the one using can be exempt from litigation. Content that falls under fair use can 
        include works of parody and assets used in non-commercial projects with express credit given.
