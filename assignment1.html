            <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
    
            <h3>Section 1.1 - Purposes of IT in modern business</h3>
            <p>IT is a vital component of any modern business model, as it allows companies to gather, store and transfer data
                with incredible speed and efficiency. For example, a company can easily compile market data from multiple branches, 
                and then quickly sort it into an organised format or isolate specific portions of data, such as from a certain branch or 
                time period, or both. It also allows instant communications across the globe, allowing for complex, detailed exchanges
                to be completed in a matter of minutes rather than the months they would normally take by a traditional postal system.
                </p>
            <p>IT has also developed at a blinding speed since its inception, going from a simple means of word processing and data 
                sorting in the late 90s to a firmly integrated staple in modern society - it is now possible to reach and influence 
                millions of active viewers over the internet at any time, as opposed to the arguably small number that could be reached 
                through a fixed billboard or the short advertisement timeslot in a television channel.
                </p>
    
            <h3>Section 1.2 - Essentials of Developing a Project</h3>
            <p>Despite being so commonplace in our daily lives, there is still a monstrous amount of work that goes on behind the 
                scenes for even quite basic elements like logos and links. It is very rare for a single person to be developing a project
                or website - usually there will be a group of people, each skilled in a specific portion of the project such as the layout
                of the page or the text and images and how they are displayed. In addition to a competent team, sufficient hardware is 
                also a necessity. Each member will need a computer capable of running the software required for development, and they 
                often also have mobile devices for developing on to ensure that the project is in a clear, suitable form for the different 
                yet quite pervasive hardware.
                </p>
    
            <h3>Section 1.3 - How I'll Develop this Website</h3>
            <p>I will plan my website mainly through sketches and drawings for the layouts and details for each page. The text will be typed
                beforehand, and added in later with the appropriate formatting (headings, lists, links etc.). I will keep each task logged on
                a <a href="https://trello.com/b/PD5hjM51/felix-arnold-website-development">Trello board</a>, so that I can keep close track 
                of how many tasks I need to complete along with the specific content and urgency of each one, and check them off as I complete 
                them. I will use HTML for the main content of the blog, and CSS to customise certain elements, such as the font, backgrounds 
                and general aesthetic of the page.
                </p>
    
            <h3>Section 1.4 - Risks of Web Development</h3>
            <p>Creating and developing projects comes with a myriad of risks and drawbacks, and any single one is a potential means to failure 
                if not understood and handled as soon as possible. One of the most prominent risks in this field is monetary- higher level web
                development can be very costly, so it is vital to keep track of every expense (staff, hardware, software, domains, assets) and
                either budget or make cuts accordingly. Another big risk to projects is hacking, as anything from malicious software/viruses
                to data breaches and DDoS attacks can render important data compromised or corrupted. This can also cause severe damage to the
                source code, and may render the project out of commission for long periods while more resources are put into fixing it, or
                outright leave it in an irreparable state and force the whole thing to be scrapped.
                </p>
    
    
            <h3>Section 1.5 - Suitable Software</h3>
            <p>There are many factors to take into consideration when choosing software for IT development. The most important one is relevance -
                any software I am using needs to have a function that suitably aids me with developing this specific project. It also needs to 
                be accessible and easy to use, as I want to be spending as much time as possible working on the project and time spent working 
                out a needlessly complicated program is effectively time wasted. Examples of good programs include calendar apps, as i can easily 
                schedule and keep track of tasks, and word processing apps which will let me transcribe and spellcheck the text before pasting 
                it into the website.
                </p>
    
            <h3>Section 1.6 - Software I Chose</h3>
            <p>The software I used to develop my website consisted of four main programs: Visual Studio Code, Github, Trello, and Google Docs.
                </p>
            <p>VSC was used to create the main HTML document; I created a base file for creating and sorting the content, and a separate CSS 
                file to format it, such as customising the colours and font, and add margins. It also had a built in terminal which allowed me 
                to easily upload any changes made to the project onto Github, which had a live version of the site accessible on it for viewing. 
                In addition to hosting the project, Github offered a personalised profile of me for others to view.
                </p>
            <p>Trello is functionally best described as a ‘smart calendar’ - It let me create a series of checklists for this project, which I 
                could quickly keep tagged and up to date, giving me a welcome measure of clarity and organisation. Finally, Google Docs was my 
                word processor of choice as, in addition to having all of the important features, also offered a reliable backup by automatically 
                saving any changes I made to a cloud storage in real time.
                </p>
            
            <h3>Section 1.7 - Legal Gonstraints for Businesses</h3>
            <p>When gathering information from users it is important to keep the General Data Protection Regulation in mind, so as to avoid 
                impeaching on their privacy and risking lawsuits. Introduced in 2018, the GDPR is a framework that is intended to make individuals’ 
                rights clearer to both them and companies alike, and make it much easier to enforce them. In order to comply with these regulations, 
                businesses must not make the personal information of any individual, client or otherwise, without express consent, and is not permitted 
                to collect data without specifying it to the individual or use it in any way other than what they claim.
