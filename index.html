<h3>Section 1.1 - Purposes of IT in modern business</h3>
<p>IT is a vital component of any modern business model, as it allows companies to gather, store and transfer data with incredible speed and efficiency. For example, a company can easily compile market data from multiple branches, and then quickly sort it into an organised format or isolate specific portions of data, such as from a certain branch or time period, or both. It also allows instant communications across the globe, allowing for complex, detailed exchanges to be completed in a matter of minutes rather than the months they would normally take by a traditional postal system.
    IT has also developed at a blinding speed since its inception, going from a simple means of word processing and data sorting in the late 90s to a firmly integrated staple in modern society - it is now possible to reach and influence millions of active viewers over the internet at any time, as opposed to the arguably small number that could be reached through a fixed billboard or the short advertisement timeslot in a television channel.
