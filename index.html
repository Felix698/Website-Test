    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a 21 year old man from Cheshire with a penchant for coding, creating and cats. I initially joined CodeNation to build up my skills
        in coding, as complications in college prevented me from being able to pursue it. whilst the course is a lot more web-oriented than i had 
        originally anticipated, I have still enjoyed myself and learned a lot of valuable skills while creating these projects, and was even able 
        to apply my skills in my own time for some personal endeavors, such as a program that can play rock-paper-scissors.
