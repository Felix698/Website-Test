<h3>Section 1.1 - Purposes of IT in modern business</h3>
<p>IT is a vital component of any modern business model, as it allows companies to gather, store and transfer data with incredible speed and efficiency. For example, a company can easily compile market data from multiple branches, and then quickly sort it into an organised format or isolate specific portions of data, such as from a certain branch or time period, or both. It also allows instant communications across the globe, allowing for complex, detailed exchanges to be completed in a matter of minutes rather than the months they would normally take by a traditional postal system.
    IT has also developed at a blinding speed since its inception, going from a simple means of word processing and data sorting in the late 90s to a firmly integrated staple in modern society - it is now possible to reach and influence millions of active viewers over the internet at any time, as opposed to the arguably small number that could be reached through a fixed billboard or the short advertisement timeslot in a television channel.

    <h3>Section 1.2 - Essentials of Developing a Project</h3>
    <p>Despite being such a commonplace in our daily lives, there is still a monstrous amount of work that goes on behind the scenes for even quite basic elements like logos and links. It is very rare for a single person to be developing a project or website - usually there will be a group of people, each skilled in a specific portion of the project such as the layout of the page or the text and images and how they are displayed. In addition to a competent team, sufficient hardware is also a necessity. Each member will need a computer capable of running the software required for development, and they often also have mobile devices for developing on to ensure that the project is in a clear, suitable form for the different yet quite pervasive hardware.

    <h3>Section 1.3 - How I'll Develop this Website</h3>
    <p>I will plan my website mainly through sketches and drawings for the layouts and details for each page. The text will be typed beforehand, and added in later with the appropriate formatting (headings, lists, links etc.). I will keep each task logged on a Trello board, so that I can keep close track of how many tasks I need to complete along with the specific content and urgency of each one, and check them off as I complete them.
